Resistance evolution to pesticides is a major threat to food security worldwide. Inspired by recent advances in medical research, we propose an ecologically inspired new paradigm in pest management through pesticide use that capitalizes on competitive interactions between pesticide-sensitive and pesticide-resistant individuals within the pest population, and not the immediate pest eradication. Using a mathematical model, we show that containing pests’ abundance at critical levels, instead of seeking its immediate eradication, diminishes management failure by reducing resistant individuals' growth rates, and consequently the time until resistant-pest dominance. We show that management strategies that maximize the abundance of pesticide-sensitive individuals or explore the potential competitive ability of these populations can significantly dampen resistance proliferation. Ultimately, our proposed approach pleads for smarter management, reconciling key challenges in environmental management practices and highlighting the importance of managing threats to the food production systems using a proactive, ecologically- and evolutionary-informed, approach.
