Resistance evolution to pesticides is a major threat to food security worldwide. Inspired by recent advances in medical research, we propose an ecologically inspired new paradigm in pest management through pesticide use that capitalizes on competitive interactions between pesticide-sensitive and pesticide-resistant individuals within the pest population, and not the immediate pest eradication. Using a mathematical model, we show that containing pests’ abundance at critical levels, instead of seeking immediate eradication, diminishes management failure by reducing resistant individuals' growth rates, and consequently the time until resistant-pest dominance. We show that management strategies that maximize the abundance of pesticide-sensitive individuals or explore the potential competitive ability of these populations can significantly dampen resistance proliferation. Ultimately, our results provide a framwork that diminishes the reliance on the success of pest management in the discovery of novel pesticides, and supports such success due to an ecologically-informed pesticide use protocol. Ultimately, our proposed approach pleads for smarter management, reconciling key challenges in environmental management practices and highlighting the importance of managing threats to the food production systems using a proactive, ecologically and evolutionary-informed, approach.

We believe that the results and conclusions provided in this study will be of interest to a wide audience, not just to those working with basic science, but also to those who are closely working with conservation and management issues.
