Resistance evolution to pesticides is a major threat to food production worldwide. Inspired by recent advances in medical research, we propose an ecological inspired new paradigm in pest management through pesticide use that capitalizes on competitive interactions between pesticide-sensitive and pesticide-resistant individuals within the pest population, and not the immediate pest eradication. Using a mathematical model, we show that containing pests’ abundance at critical levels, instead of seeking immediate eradication, diminishes management failure by reducing resistant individuals' growth rates, and consequently the time until resistant-pest dominance. We show that management strategies that maximize the abundance of pesticide-sensitive individuals or explore the potential competitive ability of these populations can significantly dampen resistance proliferation. Ultimately, our results provide a framework that diminishes the reliance on the success of pest management in the discovery of novel pesticides and supports such success due to an ecological-informed pesticide use protocol. Our study highlights the mechanisms and provide directions towards a smarter pest management, reconciling key challenges in environmental management practices and highlighting the importance of managing threats to the food production systems using a proactive, ecological, and evolutionary-informed approach.
We believe that the results and conclusions provided in this study will be of interest to a wide audience, not just to those working with basic science regarding coexistence, competition, and population dynamics, but also to those who are closely working with management issues.

Yours sincerely,
Dr. Rafael D. Guariento on behalf of co-authors
