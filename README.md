# Codes for reproducing simulations available in: Turning Ecology Against Pesticide Resistance: Exploiting Competition in Pest Populations Through Pesticide Use - by Guariento et al.

This code was addapted from [Strobl et al (2021)](https://github.com/MathOnco/AT_costOfResistance_LVModel) and is distributed under the GNU license.

The easiest way to run the .ipynb files is to upload them in google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index). This will allow runnig the codes without instalation of python or its libraries.
